# LLM Peer Review

Existing solutions for editing and reviewing written text using LLMs haven't met my needs. The edits the LLM makes to a text are not clear to see in regular chat UI's, and sometimes large swathes of text would end up getting re-written in ways I wouldn't like.  Inspired by the document review features in Google Docs, which allows collaborators to comment on particular parts of a document and suggest edits that the original author can either accept or reject, I built this small webapp using React, Next.js, and some help from Claude 3.5 Sonnet to allow LLMs to markup text like a human editor would with comments, insertions and replacements.
